## About The Project

Introducing our new chatbot that helps visually impaired people navigate their way around town with ease. Our chatbot uses MapQuest API to provide users with accurate and up-to-date directions to their desired location. But that's not all â€“ our chatbot also offers a unique feature that summarizes the directions and reads them out loud to the user. This means that visually impaired users can quickly and easily understand the directions without having to rely on someone else to read them. Our chatbot is easy to use and accessible to everyone. Simply type in your desired location and let our chatbot guide you there. The chatbot is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, and is constantly learning and improving to provide the best possible experience for our users. We're proud to offer a chatbot that helps visually impaired people maintain their independence and explore the world around them with confidence.
